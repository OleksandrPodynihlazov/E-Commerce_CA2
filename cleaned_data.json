In the Solar Sync system, sensors of increased density and temperature are used to determine evapotranspiration (ET) indicators on the territory of the site, as well as the speed at which plants and turf use the applied load. In addition, Solar Sync includes Hunter's Rain-Clik® Rain and Freeze-Clik® Freeze Sensors, which shut off your irrigation system during rain and/or freezing weather.</p> <p><iframe allowfullscreen=\" allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TTUpLIjlRj8\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></p> <p>Ultimately, a new efficient irrigation system is produced that will save water and improve the condition of the plants on the site. Program the controller as usual and Solar Sync goes all out, with manual watering schedule adjustments possible.</p> <p>The Solar Sync system can be easily installed on any supported Hunter device controller (see owner's manual or owner's manual controller to see if it is compatible with Solar Sync). The system consists of a sensor and a receiver. The receiver is required only in the assembly with the wireless sensor. The sensor should be triggered when atmospheric emissions are triggered, in which the maximum amount of increased radiation is set. The receiver is installed next to or on top of the Hunter controller. The Solar Sync sensor measures the amount of light and temperature, and also calculates the daily evapotranspiration (ET) in order to provide the best quality irrigation.</p> <p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" loading =\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7taNNhtBbjA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></p> <p>This option is the amount of water that plants lose under the influence of local climatic factors, and which must be replenished with irrigation. The Solar Sync sensor also comes with a Hunter Rain-Clik sensor that automatically shuts off the irrigation system when it rains, preventing excessive water use. Enter the midsummer watering schedule on the controller according to the instructions in the Owner's Manual. Solar Sync receives data from the sensor and applies it to the controller's watering schedule, changing the programmed watering duration through the controller's seasonal adjustment feature.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"381\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/uploads/images/hunter/sync-sen_12.jpg\" width=\"1225\"/></p> <h3>Solar Sync System Components</h3> <p>Rain-Clik sensor prevents watering from starting or continuing during rain. It requires no setup or calibration. Rain-Clik uses patented Quick Response® technology that shuts off the irrigation system within the first few minutes after it starts raining. The only element that needs to be adjusted is the ventilation ring, which allows you to slow down or speed up the drying process of the sensor and the time of reactivation of the irrigation system. Opening<br/> vents accelerates drying of the sensor, closing them slows it down.</p> <p>In addition, the built-in Solar Sync temperature sensor shuts down the system when frost is detected. At temperatures around 37°F (3°C) and below, Solar Sync signals the controller to stop watering. After the sensor is activated, the message \"Sensor off\" is displayed on the controller display. When the temperature rises above 37°F (3°C), automatic watering is turned back on.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"547\" loading=\"lazy \" src=\"/content/uploads/images/hunter/sync-sen_14.jpg\" width=\"666\"/></p> <h3>Solar Sync Wireless System Components</h3> <p>Into Solar Wireless System Design Sync includes a downward pointing antenna, which ensures communication with the receiver.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"789\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/uploads/images /hunter/sync-sen_15.jpg\" width=\"639\"/></p> <h3>Solar Sync Wireless Receiver</h3> <p>The Solar Sync receiver can be mounted on the wall next to the controller or in a cutout on the side parts controller.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"461\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/uploads/images/hunter/sync-sen_16 .jpg\" width=\"274\"/></p> <h3>Dimensions</h3> <ul> <li>Solar Sync Wired Sensor (with mounting bracket): Height 8cm/Width 22cm/Depth 2cm. </li> <li>Wireless Solar Sync Sensor (with mounting bracket): height 11cm/width 22cm/depth 2.5cm.</li> <li>Wireless Solar Sync Receiver (with wall mounting kit): height 14cm / width 4 cm / depth 4 cm.</li> <li>Protective case for wireless sensor (with mount): Height: 7 cm. / Length: 9.5 cm.

Program the controller as usual and Solar Sync will do the rest<br/>, eliminating the need to manually adjust the watering schedule.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"341 \" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/uploads/images/hunter/hunter-solar-sync-kit-5.jpg\" width=\"817\"/></p> <h3>Principle of work</h3> <p>Solar Sync wireless system is easy and simple install on any compatible Hunter Irrigation Controller (see Owner's Manual for compatibility).</p> <p>Solar Sync wireless sensor measures solar radiation and temperature and calculates daily total evapotranspiration (ET) to adjust irrigation. The latter reflects the amount of moisture lost by plants under the influence of local climatic factors, which must be replenished with irrigation. The Solar Sync Wireless System also includes Rain-Clik™ and Freeze-Clik® sensors that allow you to automatically turn off the irrigation system in the event of rain or frost.</p> <p>Set a midsummer watering schedule in the controller by following the programming instructions in your controller's manual. The Solar Sync sensor sends weather data to the control module, which adjusts the controller's watering schedule using the seasonal adjustment function.</p> <p><strong>This user guide applies to the following kits:</strong></ p> <ul> <li>WSS: Solar Sync Wireless Sensor Set for Hunter Pro-C, PCC, ICC and I-Core Controllers</li> <li>WSSSEN*: Solar Sync Wireless Sensor Set for Hunter ACC and X Controllers -Core</li> </ul> <p>* - Please note that the Solar Sync control module is not included in the WSSSEN kit. ACC and X-Core controllers have built-in Solar Sync software, eliminating the need for a separate control module. Therefore, the WSSSEN kit is intended for use with ACC and X-Core controllers only.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"647\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/uploads/images/hunter/hunter-solar-sync-kit-06.jpg\" width=\"972\"/></p> <hr/> <p style=\"text-align: center; \"><strong style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Buy a wireless kit Hunter solar synchronization sensor for automatic irrigation systems by placing an order on the website </strong><a href=\"https://avtopoliv.com.ua/\" style=\"font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;\"> Avtopoliv.com.ua</a><strong style=\"font-size: 18px;\"> or by phone +38 (063) 135-55-35.</strong></p> <p style=\"text -align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Avtopoliv is your reliable supplier of irrigation systems!</strong></span></span></p> </div> </div>",

The energy of the flowing water pushes the pendulum (oscillator), which, under the action of the spring, returns to its original position and hits the rear part of the plastic switch on the jet pipe. This is how the sprinkler rotates. The sprinkler rotates when it reaches the right pivot point, which is determined by the rings on the sprinkler base. The switch clicks automatically and the pendulum swings the other way, which now hits the plastic switch blocking it on the opposite side. The sprinkler moves at the same speed in both directions. Setting the spray angle with the help of movable rings on the base. Together with the movement of the pendulum, the diffuser interacts, which, when the sprinkler turns, sinks into the stream of water, shortening the radius and dispersing.</p> <p>The lower base is made of brass, the inner rotating sleeve is made of stainless steel. The body of the sprinkler, the jet tube and the pendulum are made of light aluminum alloys. Nozzles made of wear-resistant plastic. Stainless steel springs. Bearing of rotary joint and pendulum.

The energy of the flowing water pushes the pendulum (oscillator), which under the action of the spring returns to its original position and hits the back of the plastic switch on the jet pipe. This is how the sprinkler rotates. The sprinkler rotates when it reaches the right pivot point, which is determined by the rings on the sprinkler base. The switch clicks automatically and the pendulum swings the other way, which now hits the plastic switch blocking it on the opposite side. The sprinkler moves at the same speed in both directions. Setting the spray angle using movable rings on the base. Together with the movement of the pendulum, the diffuser interacts, which, when the sprinkler turns, sinks into the stream of water, shortening the radius and dispersing.</p> <p>The lower base is made of brass, the inner rotating sleeve is made of stainless steel.

The energy of the flowing water pushes the pendulum (oscillator), which under the action of the spring returns to its original position and hits the back of the plastic switch on the jet pipe. This is how the sprinkler rotates. The sprinkler rotates when it reaches the right pivot point, which is determined by the rings on the sprinkler base. The switch clicks automatically and the pendulum swings the other way, which now hits the plastic switch blocking it on the opposite side. The sprinkler moves at the same speed in both directions. Setting the spray angle using movable rings on the base. Together with the movement of the pendulum, the diffuser interacts, which, when the sprinkler turns, sinks into the stream of water, shortening the radius and dispersing.</p> <p>The lower base is made of brass, the inner rotating sleeve is made of stainless steel. The body of the sprinkler, the jet tube and the pendulum are made of light aluminum alloys. Nozzles made of wear-resistant plastic. Stainless steel springs. Bearing of rotary joint and pendulum. U-type rubber seal. Comes with a set of 3 replacement nozzles. The possibility of using nozzles from 18 to 36 mm.

The use of a wedge insert to change the trajectory will affect the jet range.</p> <p>Big Gun® performance data is obtained under ideal test conditions, so actual data may be affected by faulty hydraulic input conditions and other factors.</p> <p >The test lift height is 0.91 m above the measuring surface.

This multi-functional solution is easy to install and makes it easy to connect your home irrigation system with HomeKit.</p> <p>The smart water controller securely attaches to an outdoor faucet, and thanks to the accessory's standard 26.5mm/G ¾\" thread, you can easily connect conventional hoses and other popular hose systems (such as Gardena or K&amp;rcher) with the included hose.</p> <ul> <li>Autonomous schedules</li> <li>7 watering periods/day</li> <li>No bridge and sluice</li> <li>Compatible with all popular hose systems</li> <li>Bluetooth and flow</li> <li>High data privacy</li> </ul> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"885\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/uploads/images/aqualin/eve-aqua-10ecc8101-04.jpg\" width=\"900\"/></p> <p>Eve Aqua has a single built-in button that starts or stops the water flow with a single touch Tap once and the valve will open. Eve Aqua will automatically turn off the water supply after a set time that you can set in the Eve app - a really easy way to water your lawn without wasting precious water. Eve Aqua is also equipped with HomeKit technology and enough memory to store complex schedules. This means you can start watering from your iPhone or Siri, and if you have a home hub, you can even do it while on vacation. You can also take it a step further and use Eve to add schedules that are then stored in Eve Aqua for a fully automated irrigation system.</p> <p>The latest generation Eve Aqua supports Bluetooth and Thread and automatically connects to your Thread networks. Thread makes your smart home network more responsive, reliable, and extends its reach—all you need is the HomePod mini. You can even add Thread support to the latest generation Eve Aqua by simply updating the accessory's firmware.</p> <p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web -share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vs7Zk3Nsnsw\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></p> <h3>Flow control</h3> <p><strong>Using a schedule</strong></p> <p>A schedule starts regular watering of the garden in at the time and for the period you specify. Because schedules are stored directly in Eve Aqua, they can be run at any time—whether Eve Aqua is connected to your iPhone or the Internet, all without a bridge or gateway.</p> <p style=\"text- align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"435\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/uploads/images/aqualin/eve-aqua-10ecc8101-20.jpg\" width=\"805\"/ ></p> <p><strong>Via iPhone, Siri or directly on the device</strong></p> <p>You can water at any time with one push of a button on board. But it is even more convenient to control Eve Aqua from iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and with the help of Siri.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"520\" loading=\"lazy \" src=\"/content/uploads/images/aqualin/eve-aqua-10ecc8101-10.jpg\" width=\"520\"/></p> <p><strong>Stopping schedule</strong></p> <p>On vacation you saw in the summary weather that the heat is about to set in at home. Not a problem. With your home hub — HomePod, HomePod mini, or Apple TV — you can stay connected and easily water your garden on the go. If the weather turns out to be better than forecast, you can stop the schedule whenever you want, wherever you are.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"852\" loading =\"lazy\" src=\"/content/uploads/images/aqualin/eve-aqua-10ecc8101-19.jpg\" width=\"1060\"/></p> <p><strong>Auto shut off</strong>< /p> <p>Water losses and floods due to forgetfulness are a thing of the past. After you've manually started watering, Eve Aqua automatically shuts off the water again after a time you specify once - reliably, quickly and silently thanks to the magnetic valve.</p> <p>How much water is your garden using? The Eve program constantly calculates the amount of watering.;</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"670\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/uploads/images /aqualin/eve-aqua-10ecc8101-16.jpg\" width=\"338\"/></p> <p><strong>Eve Aqua can be controlled via the Eve app, Home and Siri</strong></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"784\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/uploads/images/aqualin/eve-aqua-10ecc8101-18.jpg\" width=\"1000\"/></p> <hr/> <h3> Installation</h3> <p>You can install Eve Aqua on almost any outdoor faucet. Just make sure you screw the accessory all the way onto the faucet with your fingers and that it's securely attached to prevent leaks.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"738\" loading =\"lazy\" src=\"/content/uploads/images/aqualin/eve-aqua-10ecc8101-11.jpg\" width=\"1312\"/></p> <p>To insert or replace the batteries, press gently with your thumbs on the ridged surface at the bottom of the Eve Aqua and then slide the lid forward. The tape makes it easy to remove the batteries - just wrap it around them and fully insert them into the compartment before closing the cover. Leaving it hanging outside can cause moisture to enter the case and battery compartment.</p> <p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" loading=\"lazy\" src= \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_EQ405oWjz0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></p> <p>At the end of the gardening season, protect Eve Aqua from frost, like most loose irrigation devices, to avoid damage to moving parts, seals, and fasteners. It is best to unscrew the Eve Aqua from the tap, clean the accessory, open the valve, remove the batteries and allow everything to dry thoroughly before putting it away for the winter.</p> <p>Thanks to the standard thread, hose connection and the ability to withstand a wide range of pressures of water (1 bar/14.5 psi to 5 bar/72.5 psi) Eve Aqua is ideal for use with all conventional irrigation systems. You can also connect it to a 2-prong jack, among other types of multi-channel splitters. With this setup, Eve Aqua is always supplied with water, leaving you with one outlet to connect a conventional hose. The possibilities are truly endless.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Eve Aqua is compatible with all popular hose systems and multi-channel water dispensers such as Gardena or K&amp;aucher and can be installed in minutes. It's also ideal for more complex watering tasks, as Eve allows you to set up to seven individual daily watering periods for each day.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" height=\" 516\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/uploads/images/aqualin/eve-aqua-10ecc8101-13.jpg\" width=\"850\"/></p> <p>Even if you only go on weekends , flowers in pots or vegetables in raised beds still require regular watering. Prevent them from wilting by solving this problem quickly and economically with Eve Aqua and the Gardena micro-drip irrigation system.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"794\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/uploads/images/aqualin/eve-aqua-10ecc8101-15.jpg\" width=\"850\"/></p> <p>Thanks to the two-channel water distributor you can use Eve Aqua for watering without turning off the faucet. and you won't need to take Eve Aqua off when you just need to fill the kiddie pool or wash your hands.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"639 \" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/uploads/images/aqualin/eve-aqua-10ecc8101-21.jpg\" width=\"850\"/></p> <hr/> <h3>Technical requirements</ h3> <ul> <li>iPhone or iPad with the latest version of iOS/iPadOS</li> <li>HomePod or Apple TV (4th generation or later) is required as a home hub to automatically control this HomeKit-enabled accessory away from home</li> </ul> <h3>Technical characteristics</h3> <ul> <li>Hose 26.5 mm/G ¾\"</li> <li>Operating temperature range 4°C - 50°C</li> <li>Pressure: 1 bar - 5 bar</li> <li>IPX4 waterproof</li> <li>UV protection</li> <li>Charging: 2 replaceable AA batteries</li> <li >Wireless connection</li> <li>Dimensions: 77x95x128 mm</li> </ul> <h3>Complete set</h3> <ul> <li>Controller Eve Aqua water</li> <li>2 AA batteries</li> <li>Hose connector</li> <li>Instructions</li> <li>Installation video (EN/US)</li> </ul> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1101\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/uploads/images/aqualin/eve-aqua-10ecc8101 -05.jpg\" width=\"1090\"/></p> <hr/> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Buy Eve Aqua Wi-Fi controller for systems automatic watering, you can place an order on the website </strong><a href=\"https://avtopoliv.com.ua/\" style=\"font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;\">Avtopoliv.com.ua</a><strong style=\"font-size: 18px;\"> or by phone +38 (063) 135-55-35.</strong></ p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Avtopoliv is your reliable supplier of irrigation systems!</strong></span></span></p> </div> </div>",

Gradual distribution is carried out due to continuous work. A characteristic feature of the design is the presence of a compensation system. Its main purpose is to ensure the same flow along the entire length of the hose. The water is gradually absorbed, reaching the final goal. According to the design device, installation is carried out quickly. The natural flexibility, due to the underlying material, ensures the flexibility of the hose and resistance to breakage.</p> <p>The drip tube with pressure compensation works even if there is a change in pressure. It is noteworthy that the volume of water used does not change. The use of this type of pipe is an ideal solution for areas with different heights.</p> <p>Designs with pressure compensation are characterized by greater practicality. Those at the base of the dropper align the tube when supplying water. This allows you to freely use the structure in places with height differences.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"386\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/ uploads/images/irritec/fama440332f.jpg\" width=\"1267\"/></p> <h3>Applications</h3> <p>The drip tube is an affordable way to irrigate areas of any size. The device belongs to the inexpensive class. For the price, you won't find a better offer. An exception is the drip tape, but it only partially performs the functions of a drip tube.</p> <p>The design is used for watering and irrigation in summer cottages, gardens, greenhouses, flower beds, vineyards, etc. There are many areas of application of the design (including agriculture), which emphasizes its versatility.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"533\" loading=\"lazy\" src =\"/content/uploads/images/presto_ps/mcl-100-200_09.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></p> <hr/> <h3>Functional features</h3> <ul> <li>possibility use under low pressure</li> <li>reasonable price</li> <li>versatility (many areas of application)</li> <li>water savings due to automation</li> <li>long service life</li> < /ul> <p>Using a drip tube ensures a uniform supply of water, which is necessary for the full growth of plants.

The main advantage of a drip tube with built-in droppers, compared to a drip tape, is the possibility of using it for a longer period of time - from 3 to 7 years. The thick wall, made of high-quality material, allows you not to take the tube away for the winter without reducing its service life.</p> <p>The perennial drip tube Eurodrip is a PVC tube with a diameter of 16 mm and a wall thickness of 0.9 mm. Has no seams, burrs and welded joints. Every 33 cm, it has built-in cylindrical droppers (emitters) for 4 outputs with a long, large-area filtering labyrinth for minimal risk of contamination of the dropper. Water consumption from each dropper is 2 l/h. A wide range of fittings allows you to quickly and reliably create a new irrigation system or connect to an existing one.</p> <p>A perennial tube is used for root irrigation and fertilizing both in open ground and in greenhouses. In addition to the usual range of applications, it is optimally suitable for organizing irrigation of gardens, vineyards, berry crops.</p> <p>The drip tube is easily installed in a short time and with minimal labor costs. Application as part of a special ultraviolet filter reliably protects it from the effects of sunlight and guarantees use for up to 7 years. Use only water-soluble fertilizers. Before finishing irrigation, wash the pipes to avoid sediment deposition.</p> <p>The maximum permissible length of one branch is 350 meters, the water consumption from one dropper is 2 liters per hour, this must be taken into account for the correct construction of perennial pipe irrigation.

It is a structure consisting of drip irrigation hoses with built-in drippers and a specialized fleece material that serves to evenly distribute moisture under the soil cover. The hoses (PLD-ESD) are covered with a fleece cover and securely fixed on the fleece fabric. Rolls of fleece material together with a drip irrigation hose are rolled out on the ground, then covered with a layer of soil, thus being located directly under the root systems of plants. The water supplied from the PLD-ESD drippers is permeated by the Eco-Mat. Eco-Mat doesn't just do subsurface irrigation, it makes it great. Since the irrigation system is located under the ground cover, it can be used in places with a large concentration of people: amusement parks, city squares, shopping center territories. At the same time, you do not need to worry about vandalism and choosing the right time period for watering, because irrigation can be carried out 24 hours a day.</p> <p>Eco-Mat is also a highly effective solution for watering green roofs. When arranging a green roof, a special soil with more intensive drainage than natural soil is used. In such conditions, it is difficult to grow plants, because there is very little water in such soil. Eco-Mat provides water saturation up to 100% of the irrigation area and accumulates 2 liters of water per square meter of fleece fabric.

The main advantage of a blind drip tube, in comparison with a drip tape and a perennial tube with drippers, is the ability to organize irrigation in areas with unevenly planted plants.</p> <p>To build a system based on a blind tube, it is necessary to additionally purchase garden drippers. The distance between the droppers is set arbitrarily, depending on the location of a particular plant. Droppers are installed under the root in holes prepared in advance with a hole punch.</p> <p>Irritec blind drip tube is a PVC tube with a diameter of 16 mm and a wall thickness of 1 mm. The wall of the tube is solid, without holes and built-in emitters. A wide selection of fittings and drippers allows you to quickly and easily create a new irrigation system or connect to an existing one. Due to the presence of an ultraviolet filter in the tube, the influence of sunlight on it is reduced, which guarantees long-term use of 4-5 years or more.</p> <p>The drip tube is easily installed in a short time and with minimal labor costs.
