In addition, Solar Sync includes Hunter's Rain-Clik® Rain and Freeze-Clik® Freeze Sensors, which shut off your irrigation system during rain and/or freezing weather._x000D_\nUltimately, a new efficient irrigation system is produced that will save water and improve the condition of the plants on the site. Program the controller as usual and Solar Sync goes all out, with manual watering schedule adjustments possible._x000D_\nThe Solar Sync system can be easily installed on any supported Hunter device controller (see owner's manual or owner's manual controller to see if it is compatible with Solar Sync). The system consists of a sensor and a receiver. The receiver is required only in the assembly with the wireless sensor. The sensor should be triggered when atmospheric emissions are triggered, in which the maximum amount of increased radiation is set. The receiver is installed next to or on top of the Hunter controller. The Solar Sync sensor measures the amount of light and temperature, and also calculates the daily evapotranspiration (ET) in order to provide the best quality irrigation._x000D_\nThis option is the amount of water that plants lose under the influence of local climatic factors, and which must be replenished with irrigation. The Solar Sync sensor also comes with a Hunter Rain-Clik sensor that automatically shuts off the irrigation system when it rains, preventing excessive water use.

If the photocell (plate) is damaged, it is not recommended to repair it yourself - you need to contact a specialist who will fix the problem._x000D_\n It should be noted that the small and compact dimensions of the panel allow you to install it anywhere - it is enough to take care of the free space around it (it is not desirable to have large structures, trees that can prevent the sun's rays from entering)._x000D_\n >",

The energy of the flowing water pushes the pendulum (oscillator), which, under the action of the spring, returns to its original position and hits the rear part of the plastic switch on the jet pipe. This is how the sprinkler rotates. The sprinkler rotates when it reaches the right pivot point, which is determined by the rings on the sprinkler base. The switch clicks automatically and the pendulum swings the other way, which now hits the plastic switch blocking it on the opposite side. The sprinkler moves at the same speed in both directions. Setting the spray angle with the help of movable rings on the base. Together with the movement of the pendulum, the diffuser interacts, which, when the sprinkler turns, sinks into the stream of water, shortening the radius and dispersing._x000D_\nThe lower base is made of brass, the inner rotating sleeve is made of stainless steel.

This multi-functional solution is easy to install and makes it easy to connect your home irrigation system with HomeKit._x000D_\nThe smart water controller securely attaches to an outdoor faucet, and thanks to the accessory's standard 26.5mm/G ¾\" thread, you can easily connect conventional hoses and other popular hose systems (such as Gardena or K&rcher) with the included hose._x000D_\nAutonomous schedules_x000D_\n7 watering periods/day_x000D_\nNo bridge and sluice_x000D_\nCompatible with all popular hose systems_x000D_\nBluetooth and flow_x000D_\nHigh data privacy_x000D_\nEve Aqua has a single built-in button that starts or stops the water flow with a single touch Tap once and the valve will open. Eve Aqua will automatically turn off the water supply after a set time that you can set in the Eve app - a really easy way to water your lawn without wasting precious water. Eve Aqua is also equipped with HomeKit technology and enough memory to store complex schedules. This means you can start watering from your iPhone or Siri, and if you have a home hub, you can even do it while on vacation. You can also take it a step further and use Eve to add schedules that are then stored in Eve Aqua for a fully automated irrigation system._x000D_\nThe latest generation Eve Aqua supports Bluetooth and Thread and automatically connects to your Thread networks. Thread makes your smart home network more responsive, reliable, and extends its reach—all you need is the HomePod mini. You can even add Thread support to the latest generation Eve Aqua by simply updating the accessory's firmware._x000D_\nFlow control_x000D_\nUsing a schedule_x000D_\nA schedule starts regular watering of the garden in at the time and for the period you specify. Because schedules are stored directly in Eve Aqua, they can be run at any time—whether Eve Aqua is connected to your iPhone or the Internet, all without a bridge or gateway._x000D_\nVia iPhone, Siri or directly on the device_x000D_\nYou can water at any time with one push of a button on board. But it is even more convenient to control Eve Aqua from iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and with the help of Siri._x000D_\nStopping schedule_x000D_\nOn vacation you saw in the summary weather that the heat is about to set in at home. Not a problem. With your home hub — HomePod, HomePod mini, or Apple TV — you can stay connected and easily water your garden on the go. If the weather turns out to be better than forecast, you can stop the schedule whenever you want, wherever you are._x000D_\nAuto shut offWater losses and floods due to forgetfulness are a thing of the past. After you've manually started watering, Eve Aqua automatically shuts off the water again after a time you specify once - reliably, quickly and silently thanks to the magnetic valve._x000D_\nHow much water is your garden using? The Eve program constantly calculates the amount of watering.;_x000D_\nEve Aqua can be controlled via the Eve app, Home and Siri_x000D_\n Installation_x000D_\nYou can install Eve Aqua on almost any outdoor faucet.

The tape makes it easy to remove the batteries - just wrap it around them and fully insert them into the compartment before closing the cover. Leaving it hanging outside can cause moisture to enter the case and battery compartment._x000D_\nAt the end of the gardening season, protect Eve Aqua from frost, like most loose irrigation devices, to avoid damage to moving parts, seals, and fasteners. It is best to unscrew the Eve Aqua from the tap, clean the accessory, open the valve, remove the batteries and allow everything to dry thoroughly before putting it away for the winter._x000D_\nThanks to the standard thread, hose connection and the ability to withstand a wide range of pressures of water (1 bar/14.5 psi to 5 bar/72.5 psi) Eve Aqua is ideal for use with all conventional irrigation systems.

The possibilities are truly endless._x000D_\nEve Aqua is compatible with all popular hose systems and multi-channel water dispensers such as Gardena or K&aucher and can be installed in minutes. It's also ideal for more complex watering tasks, as Eve allows you to set up to seven individual daily watering periods for each day._x000D_\nEven if you only go on weekends , flowers in pots or vegetables in raised beds still require regular watering. Prevent them from wilting by solving this problem quickly and economically with Eve Aqua and the Gardena micro-drip irrigation system._x000D_\nThanks to the two-channel water distributor you can use Eve Aqua for watering without turning off the faucet. and you won't need to take Eve Aqua off when you just need to fill the kiddie pool or wash your hands._x000D_\nTechnical requirementsiPhone or iPad with the latest version of iOS/iPadOS_x000D_\nHomePod or Apple TV (4th generation or later) is required as a home hub to automatically control this HomeKit-enabled accessory away from home_x000D_\nTechnical characteristics_x000D_\nHose 26.5 mm/G ¾\"_x000D_\nOperating temperature range 4°C - 50°C_x000D_\nPressure: 1 bar - 5 bar_x000D_\nIPX4 waterproof_x000D_\nUV protection_x000D_\nCharging: 2 replaceable AA batteries_x000D_\nWireless connection_x000D_\nDimensions: 77x95x128 mm_x000D_\nComplete set_x000D_\nController Eve Aqua water_x000D_\n2 AA batteries_x000D_\nHose connector_x000D_\nInstructions_x000D_\nInstallation video (EN/US)_x000D_\n",

It is a structure consisting of drip irrigation hoses with built-in drippers and a specialized fleece material that serves to evenly distribute moisture under the soil cover. The hoses (PLD-ESD) are covered with a fleece cover and securely fixed on the fleece fabric. Rolls of fleece material together with a drip irrigation hose are rolled out on the ground, then covered with a layer of soil, thus being located directly under the root systems of plants. The water supplied from the PLD-ESD drippers is permeated by the Eco-Mat. Eco-Mat doesn't just do subsurface irrigation, it makes it great. Since the irrigation system is located under the ground cover, it can be used in places with a large concentration of people: amusement parks, city squares, shopping center territories. At the same time, you do not need to worry about vandalism and choosing the right time period for watering, because irrigation can be carried out 24 hours a day._x000D_\nEco-Mat is also a highly effective solution for watering green roofs. When arranging a green roof, a special soil with more intensive drainage than natural soil is used. In such conditions, it is difficult to grow plants, because there is very little water in such soil. Eco-Mat provides water saturation up to 100% of the irrigation area and accumulates 2 liters of water per square meter of fleece fabric.
