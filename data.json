        "description": "Rivulis D5000 PC/AS/ND drip line underground and on its surface<br>\nThe Rivulis D5000 PC drip line is the most significant advance in Pressure Compensated (PC) drip technology in recent decade.<br>\nThanks with the widest range of flow control, the Rivulis D5000 PC provides exceptional uniformity on hilly terrain and over long distances. This ensures that your crops at the end of the rows receive the same amount of water as they did at the beginning for a more even crop.<br>\nDesigned with a large labyrinth and outlet basin, as well as multi-zone inlet filters, every component of the Rivulis D5000 The PC is engineered to the max for superior performance and clogging resistance.<br>\nThe Rivulis D5000 Subsurface Drip Irrigation System stands out for several reasons. The system uses much less water, fertilizer and chemicals compared to overhead sprinkler irrigation. In addition, the application of fertilizers and chemicals is much easier. You can be precise in both quantity and timing, including daily application, for maximum effectiveness. Traditional irrigation methods are much less precise and therefore result in wasted fertilizers and chemicals, as well as high mechanical costs.<br>\nMulti-zone inlet connector<br>\nInlet filters – this is the first layer of protection against foreign particles. Rivulis D5000 PC is equipped with 40 independent input filters in 3 zones of each emitter, providing maximum protection against clogging. This is the most advanced filtering compared to the main competitive product on the market.<br>\nWide flow maze<br>\nGreat maze design The Rivulis D5000 PC achieves a balance between precise drainage and turbulent flow to keep solids suspended.

        "description": "Hunter Solar Sync-Sen high-tech weather sensor calculates evapotranspiration (ET) indicator<br>\nSolar Sync is a sensor system that involves connecting to the compatibility of the Hunter controller automatically adjusts the occurrence of the irrigation controller taking into account changes in the climate of climatic conditions. In the Solar Sync system, sensors of increased density and temperature are used to determine evapotranspiration (ET) indicators on the territory of the site, as well as the speed at which plants and turf use the applied load. In addition, Solar Sync includes Hunter's Rain-Clik® Rain and Freeze-Clik® Freeze Sensors, which shut off your irrigation system during rain and/or freezing weather.<br>\nUltimately, a new efficient irrigation system is produced that will save water and improve the condition of the plants on the site. Program the controller as usual and Solar Sync goes all out, with manual watering schedule adjustments possible.<br>\nThe Solar Sync system can be easily installed on any supported Hunter device controller (see owner's manual or owner's manual controller to see if it is compatible with Solar Sync). The system consists of a sensor and a receiver. The receiver is required only in the assembly with the wireless sensor. The sensor should be triggered when atmospheric emissions are triggered, in which the maximum amount of increased radiation is set. The receiver is installed next to or on top of the Hunter controller. The Solar Sync sensor measures the amount of light and temperature, and also calculates the daily evapotranspiration (ET) in order to provide the best quality irrigation.<br>\nThis option is the amount of water that plants lose under the influence of local climatic factors, and which must be replenished with irrigation. The Solar Sync sensor also comes with a Hunter Rain-Clik sensor that automatically shuts off the irrigation system when it rains, preventing excessive water use. Enter the midsummer watering schedule on the controller according to the instructions in the Owner's Manual. Solar Sync receives data from the sensor and applies it to the controller's watering schedule, changing the programmed watering duration through the controller's seasonal adjustment feature.<br>\nSolar Sync System Components<br>\nRain-Clik sensor prevents watering from starting or continuing during rain. It requires no setup or calibration. Rain-Clik uses patented Quick Response® technology that shuts off the irrigation system within the first few minutes after it starts raining. The only element that needs to be adjusted is the ventilation ring, which allows you to slow down or speed up the drying process of the sensor and the time of reactivation of the irrigation system. Opening<br>\n vents accelerates drying of the sensor, closing them slows it down.<br>\nIn addition, the built-in Solar Sync temperature sensor shuts down the system when frost is detected. At temperatures around 37°F (3°C) and below, Solar Sync signals the controller to stop watering. After the sensor is activated, the message \"Sensor off\" is displayed on the controller display. When the temperature rises above 37°F (3°C), automatic watering is turned back on.<br>\nSolar Sync Wireless System Components<br>\nInto Solar Wireless System Design Sync includes a downward pointing antenna, which ensures communication with the receiver.<br>\nSolar Sync Wireless Receiver<br>\nThe Solar Sync receiver can be mounted on the wall next to the controller or in a cutout on the side parts controller.<br>\nDimensions<br>\nSolar Sync Wired Sensor (with mounting bracket): Height 8cm/Width 22cm/Depth 2cm.<br>\nWireless Solar Sync Sensor (with mounting bracket): height 11cm/width 22cm/depth 2.5cm.<br>\nWireless Solar Sync Receiver (with wall mounting kit): height 14cm / width 4 cm / depth 4 cm.<br>\nProtective case for wireless sensor (with mount): Height: 7 cm. / Length: 9.5 cm.

        "description": "Drip tube Rain Bird underground drip irrigation system series XFS<br>\nOne of the ways to ensure a high-quality supply of water to plants is the use of autonomous irrigation systems. The variety of designs allows you to create irrigation with any feature, including the underground arrangement of irrigation pipes. The best option for this is the Irritec Rootguard drip underground pipe, which will provide green plantings with the necessary amount of moisture.<br>\nFYI. The water passing through this drip pipe must be pre-purified. The recommended filtration level is 125 microns. Operation with untreated water can eventually render the pipe unusable. The filter must be installed before the underground drip pit.<br>\nOne of the advantages of this product is the possibility of self-cleaning - this is possible thanks to a wide flow channel and a floating membrane. This design solution minimizes user intervention and increases the frequency of maintenance.<br>\nThe pipe consists of 2 layers of material, which ensures the stability and reliability of this irrigation equipment. Immunity to external influences (temperature changes, exposure to ultraviolet light, chemically active substances, moss and fungus) makes the proposed Irritec Rootguard underground pipe for drip irrigation a universal addition to any CAP.<br>\nAdvantages<br>\nGreat service life - with active operation, the pipe will last for at least 10 years, which is appreciated by users.<br>\nAn Irritec Rootguard drip pipe is laid underground, which, in addition to high-quality watering, provides anti-vandal protection, because There is no direct access to the pipe (relevant if there are pets and small children).<br>\nAesthetics - because Irritec Rootguard is underground, the pipe does not spoil the appearance of the lawn, garden or flowerbed, ie. does not affect the existing landscape design in any way.<br>\nVersatility - laying is possible both under the soil and under the lawn, regardless of the planted plants.<br>\nReduced water consumption - savings are noticeable immediately after the start of operation . In addition, there is no possibility of evaporation. Water immediately enters the soil and the root system of green plants.<br>\nAnother important feature of the Irritec Rootguard drip pipe is the use of copper coating technology, which does not allow roots to entangle the pipe, which positively affects the operation of the entire autonomous system irrigation in general.<br>\nFunctional features<br>\nDrippers intended for the SDI system are manufactured using ROOTGUARD® technology to protect the dripper itself from the inevitable ingrowth of the roots of irrigated plants into the drainage hole of the drippers.<br>\nROOTGUARD® is a trademark owned by Geoflow Inc. and is manufactured by Metzerplas under license.<br>\nROOTGUARD® technology became a revolutionary step in the development of in-soil drip irrigation.<br>\n With its appearance, as well as with the development of new, modern designs of drippers, all problems related to associated with this type of drip irrigation.<br>\nThe range of working pressures is 0.59 - 4.14 bar, which allows you to install systems autonomous irrigation with different operational pressure.<br>\nThroughput capacity – 2.1 liters per hour. This allows you to create individual watering of any plants, including undemanding ones in water.<br>\nWater temperature is 38 degrees and below. If necessary, it is possible to allow the supply of water with a slightly higher temperature for a short time.<br>\nThe ambient temperature is 52 degrees and below (the standard indicator for our country).<br>\nThe emitters are located at an equal distance, which it is necessary to remember (the pipe has the specified places). this can lead to a change in the quality of irrigation.<br>\nIrritec Rootguard drip underground pipe has a wall thickness of 1.1 mm, which allows you not to worry about accidental puncture of the material. It should be noted that the pipe is characterized by high strength and elasticity.<br>\nThe outer diameter is 16 mm, the inner diameter is 14.9 mm.<br>\nConnection to the pipeline is made according to the dimensions of the connection points.<br>\n ><br>\nInstallation<br>\nIrritec Rootguard drip underground pipe is laid according to the project without deviations from it.<br>",

        "description": "Drip tube with pressure compensation Eurodrip for organizing systems drip irrigation system<br>\nMaximum flexible, twist-resistant hose with drippers for irrigation of row plantings with a pressure compensation system.<br>\nThis is a dark brown drip hose that many irrigation contractors prefer to use. The drippers are equidistant from each other, each dripper has a flow rate of 2.3 liters per hour.<br>\nThe drip hose comes in a bay and looks like a regular (brown) polyethylene tube. If you look closely, you will see a joint protruding from the inside of the tube at regular intervals, and a small hole about a millimeter in diameter. The joint is a pressure compensating labyrinth and the water comes out of a tiny hole.<br>\nOur Eurodrip drip line is Pressure Compensated (PC), which means that each drip emitter in the coil will deliver the exact amount of water ( 2.3 liters per hour for this model), regardless of the pressure inside the pipe or whether it is at the maximum level. at the beginning of the coil or at the far end, which can be up to 100 m away.<br>\nApplication<br>\nDesigned for watering lawns, dense plantings, hedges, trees, etc.<br>\nHigh flexibility of pipes for quick and easy installation<br>\nPatented design of the dripper ensures increased reliability.<br>\nIncreased lateral length is compensated by fewer parts<br>\nStrength<br>\n1.2mm.

        "description": "Drip tube blind Irritec for organizing drip irrigation systems<br>\nThe blind drip tube is the most versatile and inexpensive choice for creating a drip irrigation system. The main advantage of a blind drip tube, in comparison with a drip tape and a perennial tube with drippers, is the ability to organize irrigation in areas with unevenly planted plants.<br>\nTo build a system based on a blind tube, it is necessary to additionally purchase garden drippers. The distance between the droppers is set arbitrarily, depending on the location of a particular plant. Droppers are installed under the root in holes prepared in advance with a hole punch.<br>\nIrritec blind drip tube is a PVC tube with a diameter of 16 mm and a wall thickness of 1 mm. The wall of the tube is solid, without holes and built-in emitters. A wide selection of fittings and drippers allows you to quickly and easily create a new irrigation system or connect to an existing one. Due to the presence of an ultraviolet filter in the tube, the influence of sunlight on it is reduced, which guarantees long-term use of 4-5 years or more.<br>\nThe drip tube is easily installed in a short time and with minimal labor costs. Use only water-soluble fertilizers. Before finishing irrigation, flush the tubes to avoid sediment deposition.<br>\nApplications<br>\nWatering crops in open ground<br>\nWatering crops in greenhouses and greenhousesWatering seedlings in open and closed ground<br>\nWatering decorative plants and flowers<br>\nHome sites<br>\nFunctional features<br>\nSimplicity of installation of the system<br>\nArbitrary location of droppers<br>\nVersatile use<br>\nAllows application of water-soluble fertilizers<br>\nInstallation<br>\nPlace the tube branches along the rows<br>\nLay the main pipe perpendicular to the rows<br>\nAt the beginning of the main pipe mount a filter for water purification. mesh or disk<br>\nConnect the tube with the supply pipe using starters or taps<br>\nPut the tube on the starter<br>\nDrill 3 mm holes at the required distance using a hole punch<br>\nInstall droppers of the desired shape<br>\nMuffle the end of each branch with a plug<br>\nIn case of mechanical damage blind tube use a repair joint<br>",

        "description": "Drip tube in fleece fabric Hunter ECO-MAT<br>\nEco-Mat is designed for irrigation of hard-to-reach areas. It is a structure consisting of drip irrigation hoses with built-in drippers and a specialized fleece material that serves to evenly distribute moisture under the soil cover. The hoses (PLD-ESD) are covered with a fleece cover and securely fixed on the fleece fabric. Rolls of fleece material together with a drip irrigation hose are rolled out on the ground, then covered with a layer of soil, thus being located directly under the root systems of plants. The water supplied from the PLD-ESD drippers is permeated by the Eco-Mat. Eco-Mat doesn't just do subsurface irrigation, it makes it great. Since the irrigation system is located under the ground cover, it can be used in places with a large concentration of people: amusement parks, city squares, shopping center territories. At the same time, you do not need to worry about vandalism and choosing the right time period for watering, because irrigation can be carried out 24 hours a day.<br>\nEco-Mat is also a highly effective solution for watering green roofs. When arranging a green roof, a special soil with more intensive drainage than natural soil is used. In such conditions, it is difficult to grow plants, because there is very little water in such soil. Eco-Mat provides water saturation up to 100% of the irrigation area and accumulates 2 liters of water per square meter of fleece fabric. When the Eco-Mat is saturated with water, it acts as a reservoir from which the plants consume moisture.<br>\nApplications: Underground drip irrigation<br>\n Consumption: 2.2 l/h<br>\nEco-Mat.

The energy of the flowing water pushes the pendulum (oscillator), which, under the action of the spring, returns to its original position and hits the rear part of the plastic switch on the jet pipe. This is how the sprinkler rotates. The sprinkler rotates when it reaches the right pivot point, which is determined by the rings on the sprinkler base. The switch clicks automatically and the pendulum swings the other way, which now hits the plastic switch blocking it on the opposite side. The sprinkler moves at the same speed in both directions. Setting the spray angle with the help of movable rings on the base. Together with the movement of the pendulum, the diffuser interacts, which, when the sprinkler turns, sinks into the stream of water, shortening the radius and dispersing.<br>\nThe lower base is made of brass, the inner rotating sleeve is made of stainless steel.

Gradual distribution is carried out due to continuous work. A characteristic feature of the design is the presence of a compensation system. Its main purpose is to ensure the same flow along the entire length of the hose. The water is gradually absorbed, reaching the final goal. According to the design device, installation is carried out quickly. The natural flexibility, due to the underlying material, ensures the flexibility of the hose and resistance to breakage.<br>\nThe drip tube with pressure compensation works even if there is a change in pressure. It is noteworthy that the volume of water used does not change. The use of this type of pipe is an ideal solution for areas with different heights.<br>\nDesigns with pressure compensation are characterized by greater practicality. Those at the base of the dropper align the tube when supplying water. This allows you to freely use the structure in places with height differences.<br>\nApplications<br>\nThe drip tube is an affordable way to irrigate areas of any size. The device belongs to the inexpensive class. For the price, you won't find a better offer.

This device is fully compatible with most existing electronic control units. The undoubted advantage of the kit is the complete absence of wires for connecting the sensors, that is, there is no need to lay them or dig trenches for their installation.<br>\nTo prevent unwanted water losses, the built-in Quick Response™ technology instantly turns off watering immediately after the start of rain.<br>\nMost devices designed to detect rain first accumulate a set amount of precipitation, and only after that a switch is triggered that disconnects the circuit from the controller and disables the system. During this \"accumulation period\", the system continues to waste water. This can be particularly disadvantageous for municipalities, businesses and residential property owners for whom cost savings is key.<br>\nUsing built-in Quick Response technology, Hunter's wired and wireless Rain-Clik sensors can provide to the controller, the shutdown command immediately after the start of rain.<br>\nPrinciple of operation<br>\nWhen water hits the sensor, the cork tree placed inside swells, which causes the contact to open, i.e. the signal is sent to the controller. Further, the control unit, having processed the information, shuts off the water or prevents its further supply during rain.<br>\nThe contact is closed when the plug dries - approximately 4 hours in sunny and warm weather. It takes up to 3 days for complete soaking (heavy and constant rainfall).<br>\nImportant! In the event of frost, the Hunter WR-Click Wireless Rain Sensor (Frost Sensor) automatically turns off the automatic irrigation system.<br>\nUsing built-in Quick Response technology, Hunter's wired and wireless Rain-Clik sensors can provide the controller will send the shutdown command immediately after the start of rain.<br>\nRain-Clik can be installed on an eaves or any flat vertical surface (for example, on a wall or fences). A special mount is also offered, which allows you to easily mount the sensor on the edge of the gutter.<br>\nDimensions<br>\nRAIN-CLIK/RFC (with mounting bracket): height: 6 cm / height: 7.6 cm. / length: 20 cm.<br>\nSGM: height: ½\" / length: 7 .6 cm.<br>\nWR-CLIK/WRF-CLIK (with mounting bracket): height: 8.3 cm./height: 10 cm.<br>\nWireless receiver<br>\n(with mount): height: 6.4 cm./ Length: 10 cm./ Length: 18 cm.<br>\nProtective case for wireless sensor (with with mount): height: 2⅞\"/ length: 4\"/ depth: 3.2 cm.<br>\nProtective case for wireless receiver (with mount): height: 12.7 cm./ length: 51.3 mm./ width: 43.7 mm./ height: 29.2 mm.<br>\nPlease note!

Dust fighter in industry. Sprayer for high-class pastures for horses. A true celebrity in the field of irrigation. The Big Gun® Series 100 Sprinkler Can Do It All.<br>\nCapabilities<br>\nThe Big Gun® Series 100 Sprinkler is a classic high-volume sprinkler that has dominated the final sprinkler market for circular rain systems for years . It is also excellent for permanent and mobile stationary irrigation systems. Simply put, no other sprayer is as widely used, surpassing the competition.<br>\nThe 100 Series is represented by the widest range of performance options and accessories in the industry. Circular or sector irrigation models, different paths (including an adjustable path model), three different nozzle types, special coatings and models for industrial waste water - the 100 series sprinklers can do it all.<br>\nPrecision Design<br>\nNelson Big Gun® sprinklers are recognized worldwide for quality, performance and technical support in the high volume irrigation industry. They are designed and manufactured using precision technologies for reliable and long-lasting operation in harsh conditions.<br>\nEach Nelson Big Gun® water cannon is subjected to the harshest to industry standards of inspection testing and quality control, including individual water testing of each sprinkler at the factory.<br>\nThe first Big Gun® sprinklers were placed on the end segments of circular sprinklers over 45 years ago as a cost-effective way to engage corner areas of rainwater installation Today, the Big Gun® remains the standard among ultimate water cannons, trusted for many years of service.<br>\nApplications<br>\nBig Gun® Vodomites are available for various fields of application with a wide range of pressure and flow values. Different irrigation trajectories, types of connections and ordering of equipment allow you to choose the ideal solution for any field of application.<br>\nStationary installation for watering corn, pastures<br>\nEco Application<br>\nDust suppression and cooling in pens<br>\nUse of waste water<br>\nDust suppression in the mining industry<br>\nFor sports fields<br>\nIrrigation<br>\nCooling of synthetic surfaces and conditioning<br>\nNozzles<br>\nConical hole<br>\nConical ring<br>\nRing<br>\nJet dispersion<br>\nBit Performance<br>\nRadius values ​​are based on trajectory 24 for the 75, 100 and 150 series, and trajectory 27 for the 200 series. At smaller values ​​of the trajectory angles, wind erosion is reduced, but spray distances are shortened.<br>\n The reduction of the spraying distance depends on the nozzle consumption. As a general rule, the spray distance is reduced by about 3% for every 3° decrease in the trajectory angle. The use of a wedge insert to change the trajectory will affect the jet range.<br>\nBig Gun® performance data is obtained under ideal test conditions, so actual data may be affected by faulty hydraulic input conditions and other factors.<br>\nThe test lift height is 0.91 m above the measuring surface. No assurances are made as to droplet condition, uniformity, application rates, or suitability for a particular application.

The combined use of Nelson distribution valves and TWIG® wireless controls opens up a completely new level in the field of irrigation and allows you to create perfect irrigation systems with Big Gun® sprinklers.<br>\nCircular Sprinkler End Sprinkler<br>\nThe first Big Gun® sprinklers were placed on the end segments of circular sprinklers over 45 years ago as a cost-effective way to engage the corner areas of the sprinkler. Today, the Big Gun® remains the standard among ultimate water cannons, trusted for many years of service.<br>\nMoving Reel with Coiled Hose<br>\nBig Series The Gun® complements this efficient irrigation system with its reliability, long life and easy maintenance. The trajectory angle of 21° provides an optimal combination of spraying distance and wind resistance; for calm weather conditions, options with a trajectory angle of 24° are available.<br>",

        "description": "Eve Aqua Smart Water Controller Apple Homekit<br>\nEve Aqua is great hardware with software that takes ease of use to the next level. This multi-functional solution is easy to install and makes it easy to connect your home irrigation system with HomeKit.<br>\nThe smart water controller securely attaches to an outdoor faucet, and thanks to the accessory's standard 26.5mm/G ¾\" thread, you can easily connect conventional hoses and other popular hose systems (such as Gardena or K&rcher) with the included hose.<br>\nAutonomous schedules<br>\n7 watering periods/day<br>\nNo bridge and sluice<br>\nCompatible with all popular hose systems<br>\nBluetooth and flow<br>\nHigh data privacy<br>\nEve Aqua has a single built-in button that starts or stops the water flow with a single touch Tap once and the valve will open. Eve Aqua will automatically turn off the water supply after a set time that you can set in the Eve app - a really easy way to water your lawn without wasting precious water. Eve Aqua is also equipped with HomeKit technology and enough memory to store complex schedules. This means you can start watering from your iPhone or Siri, and if you have a home hub, you can even do it while on vacation. You can also take it a step further and use Eve to add schedules that are then stored in Eve Aqua for a fully automated irrigation system.<br>\nThe latest generation Eve Aqua supports Bluetooth and Thread and automatically connects to your Thread networks. Thread makes your smart home network more responsive, reliable, and extends its reach—all you need is the HomePod mini. You can even add Thread support to the latest generation Eve Aqua by simply updating the accessory's firmware.<br>\nFlow control<br>\nUsing a schedule<br>\nA schedule starts regular watering of the garden in at the time and for the period you specify. Because schedules are stored directly in Eve Aqua, they can be run at any time—whether Eve Aqua is connected to your iPhone or the Internet, all without a bridge or gateway.<br>\nVia iPhone, Siri or directly on the device<br>\nYou can water at any time with one push of a button on board. But it is even more convenient to control Eve Aqua from iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and with the help of Siri.<br>\nStopping schedule<br>\nOn vacation you saw in the summary weather that the heat is about to set in at home. Not a problem. With your home hub — HomePod, HomePod mini, or Apple TV — you can stay connected and easily water your garden on the go. If the weather turns out to be better than forecast, you can stop the schedule whenever you want, wherever you are.<br>\nAuto shut offWater losses and floods due to forgetfulness are a thing of the past. After you've manually started watering, Eve Aqua automatically shuts off the water again after a time you specify once - reliably, quickly and silently thanks to the magnetic valve.<br>\nHow much water is your garden using? The Eve program constantly calculates the amount of watering.;<br>\nEve Aqua can be controlled via the Eve app, Home and Siri<br>\n Installation<br>\nYou can install Eve Aqua on almost any outdoor faucet. Just make sure you screw the accessory all the way onto the faucet with your fingers and that it's securely attached to prevent leaks.<br>\nTo insert or replace the batteries, press gently with your thumbs on the ridged surface at the bottom of the Eve Aqua and then slide the lid forward. The tape makes it easy to remove the batteries - just wrap it around them and fully insert them into the compartment before closing the cover. Leaving it hanging outside can cause moisture to enter the case and battery compartment.<br>\nAt the end of the gardening season, protect Eve Aqua from frost, like most loose irrigation devices, to avoid damage to moving parts, seals, and fasteners. It is best to unscrew the Eve Aqua from the tap, clean the accessory, open the valve, remove the batteries and allow everything to dry thoroughly before putting it away for the winter.<br>\nThanks to the standard thread, hose connection and the ability to withstand a wide range of pressures of water (1 bar/14.5 psi to 5 bar/72.5 psi) Eve Aqua is ideal for use with all conventional irrigation systems. You can also connect it to a 2-prong jack, among other types of multi-channel splitters. With this setup, Eve Aqua is always supplied with water, leaving you with one outlet to connect a conventional hose. The possibilities are truly endless.<br>\nEve Aqua is compatible with all popular hose systems and multi-channel water dispensers such as Gardena or K&aucher and can be installed in minutes. It's also ideal for more complex watering tasks, as Eve allows you to set up to seven individual daily watering periods for each day.<br>\nEven if you only go on weekends , flowers in pots or vegetables in raised beds still require regular watering. Prevent them from wilting by solving this problem quickly and economically with Eve Aqua and the Gardena micro-drip irrigation system.<br>\nThanks to the two-channel water distributor you can use Eve Aqua for watering without turning off the faucet. and you won't need to take Eve Aqua off when you just need to fill the kiddie pool or wash your hands.<br>\nTechnical requirementsiPhone or iPad with the latest version of iOS/iPadOS<br>\nHomePod or Apple TV (4th generation or later) is required as a home hub to automatically control this HomeKit-enabled accessory away from home<br>\nTechnical characteristics<br>\nHose 26.5 mm/G ¾\"<br>\nOperating temperature range 4°C - 50°C<br>\nPressure: 1 bar - 5 bar<br>\nIPX4 waterproof<br>\nUV protection<br>\nCharging: 2 replaceable AA batteries<br>\nWireless connection<br>\nDimensions: 77x95x128 mm<br>\nComplete set<br>\nController Eve Aqua water<br>\n2 AA batteries<br>\nHose connector<br>\nInstructions<br>\nInstallation video (EN/US)<br>",

        "description": "Drip tube blind Eurodrip for organizing drip irrigation systems<br>\nThe blind drip tube is the most versatile and inexpensive choice for creating a drip irrigation system. The main advantage of a blind drip tube, compared to a drip tape and a perennial tube with drippers, is the ability to organize irrigation in areas with unevenly planted plants.<br>\nTo build a system based on a blind tube, you need to additionally purchase garden drippers. The distance between the droppers is set arbitrarily, depending on the location of a particular plant. Droppers are installed under the root in holes prepared in advance with a hole punch.<br>\nThe Eurodrip blind drip tube is a PVC tube with a diameter of 16 mm and a wall thickness of 1 mm. The wall of the tube is solid, without holes and built-in emitters. A wide selection of fittings and drippers allows you to quickly and easily create a new irrigation system or connect to an existing one. Due to the presence of an ultraviolet filter in the tube, the influence of sunlight on it is reduced, which guarantees long-term use of 4-5 years or more.<br>\nThe drip tube is easily installed in a short time and with minimal labor costs. Use only water-soluble fertilizers. Before finishing irrigation, flush the tubes to avoid sediment deposition.<br>\nApplications<br>\nWatering crops in open ground<br>\nWatering crops in greenhouses and greenhousesWatering seedlings in open and closed ground<br>\nWatering decorative plants and flowers<br>\nHome sites<br>\nFunctional features<br>\nSimplicity of installation of the system<br>\nArbitrary location of droppers<br>\nVersatile use<br>\nAllows application of water-soluble fertilizers<br>\nInstallation<br>\nPlace the tube branches along the rows<br>\nLay the main pipe perpendicular to the rows<br>\nAt the beginning of the main pipe mount a filter for water purification. mesh or disk<br>\nConnect the tube with the supply pipe using starters or taps<br>\nPut the tube on the starter<br>\nDrill 3 mm holes at the required distance using a hole punch<br>\nInstall droppers of the desired shape<br>\nMuffle the end of each branch with a plug<br>\nIn case of mechanical damage blind tube use a repair joint<br>",

        "description": "Hunter Rain-Clik Rain Sensor with Quick Technology Response™<br>\nTo prevent unwanted water loss, the built-in Quick Response™ technology instantly shuts off irrigation as soon as it starts to rain.<br>\nMost devices designed to detect rain initially accumulate a given amount of precipitation, and only after that the switch is activated, which disconnects the circuit from the controller and turns off the system. During this \"accumulation period\", the system continues to waste water. This can be particularly disadvantageous for municipalities, businesses and residential property owners for whom cost savings is key.<br>\nUsing built-in Quick Response technology, Hunter's wired and wireless Rain-Clik sensors can provide to the controller, the shutdown command immediately after the start of rain.<br>\nPrinciple of operation<br>\nWhen water hits the sensor, the cork tree placed inside swells, which causes the contact to open, i.e. the signal is sent to the controller. Further, the control unit, having processed the information, shuts off the water or prevents its further supply during rain.<br>\nThe contact is closed when the plug dries - approximately 4 hours in sunny and warm weather. It takes up to 3 days for complete soaking (heavy and constant rainfall).<br>\nImportant! In the event of frost, the Hunter WR-Click Wireless Rain Sensor (Frost Sensor) automatically turns off the automatic irrigation system.<br>\nUsing built-in Quick Response technology, Hunter's wired and wireless Rain-Clik sensors can provide the controller will send the shutdown command immediately after the start of rain.<br>\nRain-Clik can be installed on an eaves or any flat vertical surface (for example, on a wall or fences).

        "description": "Hunter Soil-Clik soil moisture sensor<br>\nThis sensor allows you to avoid water loss by measuring soil moisture and turning off watering when a preset level is reached.<br>\nSoil-Clik simplifies the procedure for determining soil moisture. The Soil-Clik sensitive element uses time-tested technology to measure moisture levels in the root zone of plants. When the sensitive element detects that the required level of soil moisture has been reached, the sensor turns off irrigation, preventing excessive water consumption.<br>\nSoil-Clik consists of two components - a sensitive element for determining the level of moisture placed in the soil and an electronic module , which exchanges data with the sensitive element and the controller. The sensitive element is installed very easily: it is enough to bury it in the soil at the depth of the root zone of the plant material. The sensor can be placed at a distance of 300 meters from the controller. Each press of the button allows you to adjust the required level of humidity and leads to an immediate update of the measured value.<br>\nThe module can be connected to any AC powered Hunter controllers. In addition, it is compatible with most third-party AC-powered controllers. The Soil-Clik sensor can be programmed to shut off the irrigation system when sufficient moisture is reached.<br>\nBacked by Hunter's 5-year warranty, the Soil-Clik sensor is an effective water-saving solution when used alone or in combination with the Solar Sync® sensor, while allowing to implement the most ecological solution.<br>\nDimensions<br>\nSoil-Clik module: Height: 11 cm./ Width: 3.2 cm./ Length: 8.9 cm.<br>\nSoil-Clik sensor: Height: 8.3 cm./ Diameter: 2 cm.<br>\nAdvantages<br>\nInstant view of soil moisture level and system status<br>\nThe one-click shutdown function allows you to ignore the soil moisture indicator in special operating conditions<br>\nLow voltage model in an outdoor mounting case with power from the main controller<br>\nPossibility to connect to inputs for Hunter sensors or use to open conventional wiring virtually in any irrigation system with a supply voltage of ~24 V<br>\nUsed in conjunction with the Solar Sync™ sensor to ensure maximum water savings<br>\nOperational characteristics<br>\nSwitching current (~24 V): 5 A<br>\nCurrent consumption (~24 V): 100 mAShutdown by using a normally closed dry contact<br>\nMaximum distance from the Soil-Clik module to the controller: 2 m.<br>\nMaximum distance from the Soil-Clik module to the sensitive element of the sensor in AC power supply systems: 300 m.<br>\nMaximum distance in NODE-BT-based systems: 30 m<br>\nThe sensitive element of the sensor is equipped with a wire 80 cm long, which intended for laying directly in the ground<br>\nCertificates: UL, CUL, FCC, CE, RCM<br>\nSelecting a location for the contact sensor<br>\nThe sensitive element is installed in the root zone to ensure proper control of soil moisture.<br>\nWhen used in turf, the sensor should be placed in the root zone at a depth of approximately 15 cm (depending on the condition turf).<br>\nWhen using in an area with trees and shrubs, choose a deeper location according to the root zone.

        "description": "Drip tube blind Presto-PS for organizing systems drip irrigation<br>\nA blind drip tube is the most versatile and inexpensive choice for creating a drip irrigation system. The main advantage of a blind drip tube, in comparison with a drip tape and a perennial tube with drippers, is the ability to organize irrigation in areas with unevenly planted plants.<br>\nTo build a system based on a blind tube, it is necessary to additionally purchase garden drippers. The distance between the droppers is set arbitrarily, depending on the location of a particular plant. Droppers are installed under the root in holes prepared in advance with a hole punch.<br>\nPresto-PS blind drip tube is a PVC tube with a diameter of 16 mm and a wall thickness of 1.3 mm. The wall of the tube is solid, without holes and built-in emitters. A wide selection of fittings and drippers allows you to quickly and easily create a new irrigation system or connect to an existing one. Due to the presence of an ultraviolet filter in the tube, the influence of sunlight on it is reduced, which guarantees long-term use of 4-5 years or more.<br>\nThe tube is used for draining and applying fertilizers both in open ground and in greenhouses for humidification air with the help of sprayers \"Fog\". In addition to the usual types of application, it is optimally suitable for watering summer cottages and outbuildings, hedges, potted flowers, gardens, vineyards, berry crops.<br>\nThe drip tube is easily installed in a short time and with minimal labor costs. Use only water-soluble fertilizers. Before finishing irrigation, flush the tubes to avoid sediment deposition.<br>\nApplications<br>\nWatering crops in open ground<br>\nWatering crops in greenhouses and greenhousesWatering seedlings in open and closed ground<br>\nWatering decorative plants and flowers<br>\nHome sites<br>\nFunctional features<br>\nSimplicity of installation of the system<br>\nArbitrary location of droppers<br>\nVersatile use<br>\nAllows application of water-soluble fertilizers<br>\nInstallation<br>\nPlace the tube branches along the rows<br>\nLay the main pipe perpendicular to the rows<br>\nAt the beginning of the main pipe mount a filter for water purification. mesh or disk<br>\nConnect the tube with the supply pipe using starters or taps<br>\nPut the tube on the starter<br>\nDrill 3 mm holes at the required distance using a hole punch<br>\nInstall droppers of the desired shape<br>\nMuffle the end of each branch with a plug<br>\nIn case of mechanical damage blind tube use a repair joint<br>",

The energy of the flowing water pushes the pendulum (oscillator), which under the action of the spring returns to its original position and hits the back of the plastic switch on the jet pipe. This is how the sprinkler rotates. The sprinkler rotates when it reaches the right pivot point, which is determined by the rings on the sprinkler base. The switch clicks automatically and the pendulum swings the other way, which now hits the plastic switch blocking it on the opposite side. The sprinkler moves at the same speed in both directions. Setting the spray angle using movable rings on the base. Together with the movement of the pendulum, the diffuser interacts, which, when the sprinkler turns, sinks into the stream of water, shortening the radius and dispersing.<br>\nThe lower base is made of brass, the inner rotating sleeve is made of stainless steel.

        "description": "Hunter Freeze-Clik to disable sprinklers for a period frost<br>\nUse this sensor to turn off sprinklers during frost and ensure reliable protection of landscaping areas, walkways and driveways from icicles.<br>\nUnintentionally turning on the irrigation system during a significant freeze is one of the worst things that can happen to a landscape design area. In some regions with unpredictable temperature fluctuations, watering during frost is a danger not only to the specific object, but also to those who may pass or drive by it.<br>\nBy connecting the Freeze-Clik sensor to the system from company Hunter, these experiences can be forgotten. When frost is detected, the Freeze-Clik sensor automatically turns off the irrigation system. When the temperature rises to an acceptable level for watering, the Freeze-Clik sensor activates the irrigation system according to the program.<br>\nThe Freeze-Clik sensor is easy to install and easy to use. In addition, it can be used in conjunction with other weather-sensing devices to ensure efficient watering regardless of the vagaries of the weather.<br>\nBenefits<br>\nAutomatically shuts off the irrigation system when temperature drop below 3°C<br>\nEasily connected to automatic irrigation systems without additional adjustment<br>\nUsed together with other sensors to increase the overall efficiency of the system irrigation<br>\nTechnical characteristics<br>\nSwitching current (~24 V): 5 A<br>\nThe delivery includes a two-wire insulated wire 7 m long with a cross section of 0.5 mm.sq., which meets the requirements of the UL standard<br>\nCertificates: UL, CUL, FCC, CE, RCM<br>\nHeight: 5 see<br>\nLength: 11 cm.<br>\nWidth: 11 cm.<br>",

This is how the sprinkler rotates. The sprinkler rotates when it reaches the right pivot point, which is determined by the rings on the sprinkler base. The switch clicks automatically and the pendulum swings the other way, which now hits the plastic switch blocking it on the opposite side. The sprinkler moves at the same speed in both directions.

The main advantage of a drip tube with built-in droppers, compared to a drip tape, is the possibility of using it for a longer period of time - from 3 to 7 years. A thick wall made of high-quality material allows you not to take the tube away for the winter without reducing its service life.<br>\nIrritec perennial drip tube is a PVC tube with a diameter of 16 mm with a wall thickness of 1 mm. There are no seams, burrs or welded joints. Due to equal distances, cylindrical droppers (emitters) are built into it for 4 outputs with a long filtering labyrinth of a large area for minimal risk of contamination of the dropper. Water consumption from each dropper is 2.1 l/h. A wide range of fittings allows you to quickly and reliably create a new irrigation system or connect to an existing one.<br>\nA perennial tube is used for root irrigation and fertilizing as in open ground and in greenhouses. In addition to the usual range of applications, it is optimally suitable for organizing irrigation of gardens, vineyards, berry crops.<br>\nThe drip tube is easily installed in a short time and with minimal labor costs. Application as part of a special ultraviolet filter reliably protects it from the effects of sunlight and guarantees use for up to 7 years. Use only water-soluble fertilizers. Before finishing irrigation, wash the pipes to avoid sediment deposition.<br>\nThe maximum permissible length of one branch is 350 meters, the water consumption from one dropper is 2 liters per hour, this must be taken into account for the correct construction of perennial pipe irrigation.

It can be placed at a distance of 300 meters from the controller. Simple button operation allows you to adjust the desired humidity level with an immediate update of the actual measurements.<br>\nThe module connects to all Hunter AC powered controllers and will work with AC powered controllers from many other manufacturers. The device can be programmed to turn off watering when it senses sufficient moisture.<br>\nBacked by Hunter's 5-year warranty, the sensor is an effective water-saving device either by itself or as an addition to an irrigation system for an environmentally friendly solution.<br>\nWhen using in turf, the sensor should be placed in the root zone at a depth of approximately 15 cm (depending on the condition turf).<br>\nWhen using in an area with trees and shrubs, choose a deeper location according to the root zone. In the area with newly planted seedlings, place the sensor in the native soil at a depth of about half of the root ball.<br>",
